The program is a basic calculator that allows the user to input two numbers and select an arithmetic operation to perform. It prompts the user to choose from the following operations:

Addition (adding the two numbers),
Subtraction (subtracting the second number from the first),
Multiplication (multiplying the two numbers),
Division (dividing the first number by the second).
After the user selects an operation, the program will calculate the result and display it. If the user selects division and the second number is zero, the program will display an error message to avoid division by zero.

Key Features:
User Input: The program asks the user for two numbers (the operands).
Operation Selection: The program prompts the user to select one of four operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
Result Calculation: Based on the selected operation, the program calculates and displays the result.
Error Handling: If the user chooses division by zero, the program shows an appropriate error message.
